# Concentration
Individual Project

This is a concentration application that requires you to remember few images and match them by flipping the cards. If the images do not match you can concentrate and try to remeber the position and the image you saw at that position, so that in the next turn you are able to remember the place where you saw the image and then match it with the current image that you have opened.
